# Python Classes and Objects

This project was carried out as part of the **Software Engineering** programme at **ALX**. It aims to learn about object oriented programming (OOP), classes, objects, instances, methods and attributes in **Python**.

## Technologies
* All Python scripts are written with Python3 (version `3.8.5`)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All Python codes passed the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`) styling
